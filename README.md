## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is a large company looking to modernize their database management system with SQL. The first task for this upgraded system is to figure out how their workforce will be impacted by upcoming retirements. This new employee database is going to help the company anticipate and prepare for any labor shortages.


## Summary

* 33,118 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

* There are plenty of qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship.

* Some queries that can shed more light onto upcoming retirement might involve cross-referencing titles and birth dates to understand which departments will see the most departures, and retrieving salaries of upcoming retirees to begin budgeting for new hires.
